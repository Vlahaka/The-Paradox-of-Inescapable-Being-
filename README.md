# The Paradox of Inescapable Being: A compatibilist take.

I did not reason into an egotistical void of delusion. 
There are three rules within which I develop nilogism:

- Coherence: I must always remain within the main axiom, "Nothing" is impossible therefore Existence is necessary.

- Empirical evidence: I must always acknowledge and describe why the necessary existence manifests as it does, as observed by the scientific community.

- Realistic applicability: I must always describe the behaviour of the everyday person.
